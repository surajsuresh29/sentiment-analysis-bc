# Sentiment Analysis on BlackCoffer Articles

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on conducting sentiment analysis on 114 blog articles scraped from the [BlackCoffer](https://insights.blackcoffer.com/) website. In this project, I've explored the world of natural language processing by analyzing the sentiments expressed in a collection of blog articles from BlackCoffer.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to delve into the sentiments expressed in the BlackCoffer blog articles and provide a comprehensive understanding of their linguistic features. By analyzing variables such as positive and negative scores, polarity, subjectivity, and various linguistic metrics, we gain insights into both the emotional tone and textual complexity of the articles.
## Key Computed Variables

- Positive Score: Quantifies the positive sentiment expressed in each article.

- Negative Score: Quantifies the negative sentiment expressed in each article.

- Polarity Score: Represents the overall polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of the content.

- Subjectivity Score: Measures the extent to which the text is opinionated rather than factual.

- Average Sentence Length: Calculates the average number of words in each sentence, offering insights into the writing style.

- Percentage of Complex Words: Indicates the proportion of words that are considered complex, contributing to the text's complexity.

- FOG Index: Provides an estimate of the readability of the content based on sentence and word complexity.

- Average Number of Words per Sentence: Offers an additional perspective on sentence structure and complexity.

- Complex Word Count: Presents the count of words that are deemed complex, contributing to the overall complexity of the text.

- Word Count: The total number of words in each article.

- Syllables per Word: Measures the average syllables per word, contributing to the text's overall readability.

- Personal Pronouns: The count of pronouns referring to people, contributing to the style and engagement of the text.

- Average Word Length: Calculates the average number of characters in each word, reflecting the vocabulary's diversity and complexity.
