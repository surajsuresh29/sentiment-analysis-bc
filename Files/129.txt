The most extreme measures have occurred in California where a shelter-in-place directive was announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday. The order requires 40 million California residents to remain at home except for essential activities or jobs. In addition to critical government and healthcare roles, cafes and restaurants are allowed to stay open but only for take-out or delivery, which has already led to mass layoffs.Most Hospitality JobsThere are 4.6 million hospitality workers in the top city clustersThe pain of an extensive and prolonged coronavirus-related shutdown will be especially felt in the nation’s tourism hotspots. Roughly one in four workers in beach destinations like Kahului, on the island of Maui in Hawaii, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina are employed in the hospitality sector. The same goes for gambling towns like Atlantic City and Las Vegas, where the governor of Nevada recently announced a 30-day shutdown of all casinos.The hospitality industry matters most in beach and gambling destinations
